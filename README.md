# Simple Calculator

A web-based calculator with basic arithmetic functions. This project includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to create a functional and visually appealing calculator that allows users to perform simple mathematical calculations.

## Project Structure

- **11.html**: The main HTML file that contains the calculator layout and connects the JavaScript and CSS files.
- **11.css**: The CSS file responsible for styling the calculator, making it responsive and visually appealing.
- **11.js**: The JavaScript file that handles the calculatorâ€™s functionality, such as appending numbers, operators, clearing the display, and performing calculations.

## Features

1. **User-Friendly Interface**:  
   - A simple and intuitive design with a responsive layout.
   - The display area shows numbers and operators in real-time.
  
2. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**:
   - The calculator performs addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
  
3. **Error Handling**:
   - Displays an error message when an invalid mathematical expression is entered.

4. **Clear and Delete Functionality**:
   - The `C` button clears the entire display.
   - The `DEL` button removes the last entered number or operator.

5. **Keyboard-like Layout**:
   - The calculator is structured into a grid with buttons for numbers (`0-9`), operators, and additional functionality (`C`, `DEL`, `.`).

6. **Equal (`=`) Button**:
   - This button evaluates the current expression shown in the display and displays the result.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open the `11.html` file in any web browser.
3. Use the calculator buttons to input numbers and operators.
4. Press `=` to calculate the result or `C` to clear the display.
